## Domain-price-check

This script uses the Domain developer API to find upper and lower bands for any listing. This can help you find price estimates for houses with "unlisted" price guides. 

To use this just replace the property_id in the python code with the correct ID. This can be found at the end of the URL of each listing on https://www.domain.com.au/

The environment can be loaded from environment.yml and is called domain-checker.
